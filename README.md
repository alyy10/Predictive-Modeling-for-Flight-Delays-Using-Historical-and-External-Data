# Predictive-Modeling-for-Flight-Delays-Using-Historical-and-External-Data
Introduction
Welcome to the project on Predictive Modeling for Flight Delays Using Historical and External Data. Airline delays are a major hassle, causing inconvenience and financial losses for both airlines and passengers. This project aims to predict these delays by analyzing historical flight data and external factors like weather conditions. The goal is to enhance travel schedule management and improve passenger satisfaction.

Objectives
The project has several key objectives:

Gather and preprocess historical flight data and relevant external factors.
Explore and identify significant features that influence flight delays.
Build and train a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms.
Evaluate the performance of the models and implement the best one for practical use.
Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing
The journey began by collecting historical flight data from Kaggle, which included details like departure and arrival times, flight numbers, and airline information. Additionally, external data on weather conditions, air traffic information, and airport operations were gathered.

Once the data was collected, the preprocessing phase involved cleaning the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was also performed to understand the data better and prepare it for feature engineering.

Feature Engineering
In this phase, key features that impact flight delays were identified. Factors such as weather patterns, air traffic congestion, time of day, and seasonality were considered. New features were created through data transformation and interaction terms to boost model performance.

Model Development
With the data prepped and features engineered, the dataset was split into training and testing sets. Multiple machine learning models were then developed, including:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines
Each model was trained and optimized using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation
Evaluating the models was crucial. Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared were used to assess their effectiveness. After comparing the performance of different models, the best-performing one was selected for deployment.

Implementation and Deployment
The chosen predictive model was integrated into a user-friendly application using Flask. The application provides visualizations and actionable insights, helping users understand the predictions and make informed decisions. The best model was saved as a pkl file, and an app.py file was developed for the Flask application along with an index.html file for the web interface.

Future Enhancements
Future plans include exploring advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods and deep learning to further improve prediction accuracy. Additional data sources and real-time information will also be incorporated for more dynamic and accurate predictions.
